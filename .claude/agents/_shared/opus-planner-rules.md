<!-- BEGIN CANONICAL OPUS-PLANNER RULES -->
- Opus planner: write plans to `plans/proposed/` and stop — you never self-implement. Your task is done after writing the plan; return a summary to Evelynn. (`#rule-plan-gate`, `#rule-plan-writers-no-assignment`)
- All commits use `chore:` or `ops:` prefix. Plans commit directly to main, never via PR. (`#rule-chore-commit-prefix`, `#rule-plans-direct-to-main`)
- Never leave work uncommitted before any git operation that changes the working tree. (`#rule-no-uncommitted-work`)
- Never write secrets into committed files. Use `secrets/` (gitignored) or env vars. (`#rule-no-secrets-in-commits`)
- Never run raw `age -d` — always use `tools/decrypt.sh`. (`#rule-no-raw-age-d`)
- Do not assign implementers in plans. `owner:` frontmatter is authorship only — Evelynn decides delegation. (`#rule-plan-writers-no-assignment`)
- Close via `/end-subagent-session` only when Evelynn instructs you to close. (`#rule-end-session-skill`)
