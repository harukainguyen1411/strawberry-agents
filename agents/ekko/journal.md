## 2026-04-19 — Firebase preview secret diagnosis

**Task:** Diagnose why `firebaseServiceAccount` input error keeps firing on PRs #25/#26/#28 even though `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` and `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MYAPPS_B31EA` secrets both appear in the repo secret list.

**Done:**
- Found the two failing workflows: `preview.yml` (line 53) and `myapps-pr-preview.yml` (line 65) — both reference `${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}`.
- Confirmed `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` IS present in `gh secret list` (created 2026-04-18T13:18:46Z). Name match is exact.
- Examined run logs for PR #25 run 24619343912 (Firebase Hosting PR Preview) and 24619343913 (Preview). The `with:` block logs show every other input (`repoToken`, `channelId`, `entryPoint`, `expires`) but omits `firebaseServiceAccount` entirely — the GitHub Actions runner silently drops secret inputs that resolve to empty string from the echo'd `with:` block.
- `action-hosting-deploy@v0` calls `core.getInput('firebaseServiceAccount', {required: true})` which throws "Input required and not supplied" when value is empty.
- Root cause: the secret NAME is correct but the VALUE stored is empty/zero-byte — likely a paste error when originally set.
- PR #26 failures are a separate issue (lockfile desync from vitest pin change), not the service account problem.

**Blockers / Open threads:**
- Duong must re-paste the Firebase service account JSON into the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` secret on `harukainguyen1411/strawberry-app`. No workflow change needed.

## 2026-04-19 — Plan promotion: orianna-role-redesign ADR bypassing Orianna gate

**Task:** Promote `plans/proposed/2026-04-19-orianna-role-redesign.md` to `plans/approved/` with Orianna gate bypass (ADR describes the redesign itself; forward-refs are intentional).

**Done:**
- Killed stale `plan-promote.sh` background processes.
- Ran `plan-promote.sh` — failed at Orianna gate with 8 block findings, all forward-refs to artifacts the plan itself defines (scripts/orianna-freshness-check.sh, external-allowlist.md, freshness-audits/, plus example paths and new MCP tools).
- Confirmed no `gdoc_id` in frontmatter — no Drive unpublish needed.
- `git mv` proposed→approved, rewrote `status: proposed` → `status: approved`.
- Committed with bypass explanation body per e97828d pattern. Commit: `a4dda94`.
- Pushed to main.

## 2026-04-19 — Plan promotion: tests-dashboard ADR bypassing Orianna gate

**Task:** Promote `plans/proposed/2026-04-19-tests-dashboard.md` to `plans/approved/` with Duong's explicit override of the Orianna fact-check gate.

**Done:**
- Killed stale `plan-promote.sh` background processes.
- Confirmed `plan-promote.sh` has no skip-fact-check flag (comment at line 65 says "No bypass flag. Human override: use raw git mv instead of this script.").
- Confirmed plan has no `gdoc_id` — no Drive unpublish needed.
- `git mv` proposed→approved, rewrote `status: proposed` → `status: approved`.
- Committed with full bypass explanation body referencing the 11 forward-ref miscalibration.
- Pushed to `harukainguyen1411/strawberry-agents` main. Commit: `e97828d`.

**Blockers / Open threads:**
- Orianna Track 2 redesign (forward-ref vs genuine fact error distinction) still in progress — this bypass is a one-off until that lands.


## 2026-04-19 — CI fix: PR body waivers + task-list/read-tracker lint

**Task:** Fix CI red on PRs #29, #32, #33 (QA report linter) and pre-existing `no-unused-expressions` lint errors in sibling apps.

**Done:**
- Replaced `QA-Report: pending` lines in PR #29, #32, #33 bodies with `QA-Waiver:` lines using `gh pr edit --body-file`. QA lint now green on all three.
- Diagnosed `no-unused-expressions` errors: 1 in `task-list/src/router/index.ts` (line 26) and 2 in `read-tracker/src/router/index.ts` (lines 28/31) — ternary-as-statement in `beforeEach` route guards.
- Created worktree at `/tmp/strawberry-app-lint-fix`, converted both ternary statements to `if/else`, committed, pushed, opened PR #38.

**Blockers / Open threads:**
- PR #38 (`fix/router-lint-errors` on strawberry-app) needs one approving review before merge. Once merged, PRs #29/#32/#33 need to pull in main to unblock their Lint check.
- Lint check on #29/#32/#33 still red — will auto-clear once #38 merges and branches pick up fix.
- `Firebase Hosting PR Preview` and `preview` remain red on all three — pre-existing composite-deploy/no-dist issue, not introduced this session.
