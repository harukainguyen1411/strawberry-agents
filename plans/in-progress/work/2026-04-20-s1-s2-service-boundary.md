# ADR: Demo Studio — S1/S2 Service Boundary (Config-Management Delimitation)

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Author:** Azir (architecture)
**Scope:** `company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3` (S1) boundary vs `demo-studio-config-mgmt` <!-- orianna: ok — internal service name in missmp/company-os; not a filesystem path --> (S2). <!-- orianna: ok -->
**Companion ADR:** `plans/proposed/work/2026-04-20-session-state-encapsulation.md` (and task file `plans/2026-04-20-session-state-encapsulation-tasks.md` <!-- orianna: ok — future task file in missmp/company-os -->). Both live on `feat/demo-studio-v3` at `d327581`. This ADR **extends** the session-state ADR for most decisions; where §11 resolutions contradict SE (Session dataclass scope, `/session/new` body shape, status response shape, `configVersion` placement), the contradictions are enumerated in the companion amendment file `company-os/plans/2026-04-20-session-state-encapsulation-bd-amendment.md`. <!-- orianna: ok — cross-repo amendment file in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

## 1. Context and posture

Duong's stance, adopted verbatim (resolved 2026-04-20 s3):

> "we only care about creation of the config and manage sessions of the managed agent."

Interpreted as S1's scope: (a) host the Anthropic managed agent, (b) track the agent's session lifecycle, (c) forward requests to/from the agent. Nothing else. No config storage, no builds, no previews, no translation.

- **S1 owns session lifecycle only — strictly.** The S1 session document holds: `sessionId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `phase`, `status`, agent pointer (`managedSessionId`), `factoryRunId`, `projectId`, `outputUrls`, `qcResult`, Slack coordinates, `archivedAt`, events subcollection. **NOT** `brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode`, `configVersion` (absent unless independently justified — see §5.1), `colors`, `logos`, `card`, `params`, `ipadDemo`, `journey`, `tokenUi`. Identity fields (`brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode`) are agent-input — passed in on creation so the managed agent boots with them — but are **not persisted on the session doc**.
- **S2 owns config CRUD.** Schema, full-snapshot `DemoConfig`, version history, validation (structural + cross-field), `tokenUi` overrides, brand/market/languages/shortcode fields, `params`, `colors`, `logos`, `card`, `ipadDemo`, `journey`.
- **S3 (Factory) owns translation.** S3 fetches config from S2 itself per `company-os/tools/demo-factory/api/factory.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — cross-repo file in missmp/company-os --> line 192 (`required: [sessionId]`). S1 never translates `DemoConfig` → factory params; that family of functions (`map_config_to_factory_params`, `_build_content_from_config`, `prepare_demo_dict`) deletes from S1. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- After this ADR + the session-state ADR land, **S1 has no Firestore writes for config, no config business logic, no factory-param translation, and no identity-field persistence**; anything config-shaped is an HTTP call to S2, anything factory-shaped is a thin `POST /build {sessionId}` to S3.

The session-state ADR enforces the Firestore-side boundary for S1 via a single `session_store.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os module name, not a local file --> plus the SE.E grep gate. That gate is scoped to `from google.cloud import firestore`, so it catches "S1 writing config to Firestore" only *if and because* S1 is reading or writing the legacy `config` field via Firestore at all. The grep gate does not flag, e.g., a call site that reads `session["config"]["brand"]` after `session_store.get_session(...)` — that path would quietly carry config through the boundary. This ADR closes that gap by making the `config`/`configVersion`-shaped fields illegal on the S1 session document *at the domain level*, not only at the storage level. <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 1.1 Why now

The session-state ADR's SE.B phase (call-site migration) rewrites every site where `main.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file --> / `factory_bridge*.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file glob --> / `dashboard_service.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file --> / `phase.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file --> read `session.get("config", …)` or write `update_session_field(..., "config", …)`. If we don't settle the S1/S2 boundary first, SE.B is migrating legacy config code through a boundary that is about to disappear — producing two migrations for the same call sites and guaranteeing a rebase storm. This ADR must land **before SE.B.2** (the `main.py` call-site migration) to avoid that waste; it may land in parallel with SE.A (the additive `session_store.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os module; see line 38 suppressor --> module), since SE.A is purely additive on the storage surface. <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 1.2 What this ADR is NOT

- **NOT** a redesign of S2. S2's spec (`reference/2-config-mgmt.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec; lives at missmp/company-os/reference/ -->) is authoritative; where S1 needs a capability S2 doesn't expose, we flag it as a blocker on the S2 side, not work around it. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **NOT** a change to the S1 HTTP surface beyond what `reference/1-content-gen.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec; lives at missmp/company-os/reference/ --> already prescribes. Session-state ADR §5 and §6.3 already track the spec-drift list; this ADR only adds the items that fall out of config ejection. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **NOT** a change to the MCP server (`demo-studio-mcp` <!-- orianna: ok — internal MCP server name in missmp/company-os; not a filesystem path -->). The MCP tools (`get_schema`, `get_config`, `set_config`) already target S2 directly; S1 is not in that path and should not become one.
- **NOT** a migration plan for existing `config`-bearing session documents. Section 8 covers the backfill-or-orphan question and hands live-data handling to ops.

## 2. Decision

**Rule 1 (boundary rule at the domain level).** No S1 code path may:
  - read or write `session["config"]` (the embedded config snapshot),
  - validate config structure,
  - translate config to factory params (i.e. the `map_config_to_factory_params` / `_build_content_from_config` / `prepare_demo_dict` family),
  - load a sample/default config,
  - accept a PATCH/PUT on a config-shaped body.

**Rule 2 (integration rule).** Any S1 code that needs config *data* MUST fetch it from S2 via `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` (or a caller-specified version pin) at the moment of use. No caching of the config snapshot on the S1 session document, no "mirror-on-read" pattern. The source of truth is S2; S1 keeps a pointer (`configVersion`) and nothing else.

**Rule 3 (pointer rule).** `configVersion` is **not** carried on the S1 session doc by default. S1 does not POST to S2 at session creation (per OQ-BD-5 resolution (c)); there is no version to mirror at creation time. The first version is created when the agent's first `set_config` MCP call lands on S2. If a downstream path needs to know "which config version did this session use?", it queries S2 (`GET /v1/config/{sessionId}` → `version`) at the moment of use. If, after this ADR lands, a concrete S1-only caller requires `configVersion` on the session doc (e.g. for a pinned-build audit trail that cannot be reconstructed from S2 events), that caller must justify the field explicitly; otherwise the field is absent. The build-reproducibility argument in the old §5.3 no longer applies to S1 because S1 no longer triggers a translated build — S3 fetches the latest from S2 itself per its own spec (§5.3).

**Rule 4 (enforcement).** Extend the SE.E grep gate with two additional patterns:
  - Disallow `session\[?["\']config["\']\]?\s*=` (assignment) and `"config"\s*:` as a Firestore write field inside any file under `tools/demo-studio-v3/` <!-- orianna: ok — grep-gate pattern string; refers to company-os repo not this repo --> other than tests and an explicit migration script. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Disallow literal string `insuranceLine` anywhere under `tools/demo-studio-v3/` <!-- orianna: ok — grep-gate pattern string; refers to company-os repo not this repo --> (it's not in the S2 schema; it is the canonical symptom of legacy-config drift). <!-- orianna: ok -->

Gate exceptions are whitelisted by a single `# azir: config-boundary` comment, mirroring the SE.E convention.

## 3. Evidence — enumeration of every S1 config touchpoint

All line numbers are against `feat/demo-studio-v3@d327581` <!-- orianna: ok — git branch@commit ref, not a filesystem path -->. Orianna should fact-check this inventory before the task file is decomposed. <!-- orianna: ok -->

<!-- orianna: ok — all file paths in §3 (tools/demo-studio-v3/session.py, main.py, factory_bridge.py, factory_bridge_v2.py, factory_v2/validate_v2.py, preview.py, config_mgmt_client.py, sample-config.json, dashboard_service.py, phase.py, agent_proxy.py, logo_upload.py, setup_agent.py) are cross-repo files in missmp/company-os; this section is an architectural audit, not a local file inventory -->

### 3.1 `tools/demo-studio-v3/session.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 tool paths are in missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ --> <!-- orianna: ok -->
| Line | Function | Shape | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 42 | `create_session(...)` | writes `"config": initial_context or {}` into the new session doc | **Delete from S1** | Session doc has no business holding a config snapshot. Creation is a bare `{sessionId, status, phase, managedSessionId: null, slack*, factoryVersion, createdAt, updatedAt}` — no `configVersion`, no `config`. The caller does NOT create a first config version on S2 at creation time (per OQ-BD-5 (c)). First version is created when the agent's first `set_config` MCP call lands on S2. See §5.1. |
| 43 | `create_session(...)` | writes `"configVersion": 1` | **Delete from S1** | No `configVersion` on the S1 session doc by default. There is no version to mirror at creation time (S1 does not POST to S2). Once the agent writes the first config via MCP → S2, the version lives on S2. S1 does not need to mirror it (per Rule 3, revised). |
| 118–128 | `list_recent_sessions(...)` | reads `config.brand`, `config.insuranceLine`, `config.market` out of each session doc to compose the result | **Delete from S1** | Strict BD-1: brand/market/languages/shortcode are not on the session doc. Consumers of `/sessions` that want identity fields call S2 directly (N+1 accepted) or the UI does. `list_recent_sessions` returns lifecycle fields only. See §5.5. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| 133 | `_UPDATABLE_FIELDS` | allowlist includes `eventHistory`, `archivedAt`, `workerJobId`, `projectId`, `factoryRunId`, `outputUrls`, `managedSessionId` — all session-lifecycle-only | **Keep as-is** | None of these are config. Allowlist is already clean. The config-boundary gate from §2 will reject any future PR that tries to add `"config"`, `configVersion`, or config-shaped keys to this set. Also reject `brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode` — those are agent-input, not session-persisted. |

### 3.2 `tools/demo-studio-v3/main.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

| Line | Route / function | Shape | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 53 | module-level `SAMPLE_CONFIG: dict = {}` | default/sample config carrier | **Delete from S1** |
| 1190 | `create_new_session_ui` | `initial_context = json.loads(json.dumps(SAMPLE_CONFIG))` deep-copy + sets `brand`/`insuranceLine`/`market` | **Delete from S1** |
| 1192 | `create_new_session_ui` | `initial_context["insuranceLine"] = body.insuranceLine` | **Delete from S1** — the `insuranceLine` field is not in S2's `DemoConfig` schema at all |
| 1196–1201 | `create_new_session_ui` | passes `initial_context=initial_context` into `create_session(...)` which persists it as `session["config"]` | **Delete from S1** — replaced by "create bare session, then POST to S2 with the initial config" (§5.1) |
| 1219 | `create_new_session_ui` | `send_message(..., f"Initial context: {json.dumps(initial_context)}")` sends full config into the Managed Agent context | **Refactor** — agent-init metadata only: send the seed identity fields (`brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode`) so the managed agent boots with them. Do NOT send a full `DemoConfig`; the agent resolves via `get_schema` + `get_config` MCP calls. Exact shape of the agent-init message is Kayn's to refine in SE.F.1 follow-up work. |
| 1250–1254 | `create_new_session` (internal/Slack variant) | `seeded_context = SAMPLE_CONFIG deep-copy; seeded_context.update(body.initialContext)` and passes to `create_session(initial_context=seeded_context)` | **Delete from S1** — same treatment as UI variant. No SAMPLE_CONFIG, no initial_context persistence. The internal variant accepts the same identity-field body and boots the agent the same way. |
| 1284 | `create_new_session` | sends `json.dumps(seeded_context)` into Managed Agent | **Refactor** — same as 1219 (identity fields only, as agent-init metadata). |
| 1349 | `session_page` | `session.get("config", {}).get("brand", "New Session")` for HTML `<title>` | **Refactor-to-S2-API-call** — session doc no longer has `brand`. Call `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` on render, fall back to "New Session" on S2 404 (cold session, pre-first-set_config). Single-page-load cost. |
| 1395–1397 | `chat` (lazy managed-session create) | reads `session.get("config", {}).get("brand"/"insuranceLine"/"market")` to build the managed-agent title | **Refactor-to-S2-API-call** — fetch from S2 on the lazy-create path. `insuranceLine` is not in the S2 schema at all (see §3.2 line 1192) and disappears entirely. |
| 1439–1445 | `preview` route + `render_preview(config, config_version)` | reads `session.get("config", {})` and `session.get("configVersion", 0)` and renders Jinja template | **Delete from S1** — preview is S5 (iframe) scope per OQ-BD-3 resolution. S1 does not render previews, does not serve preview routes, does not track `configVersion` for UI pinning. The `/preview` <!-- orianna: ok — HTTP route name, not a filesystem path --> route deletes from S1; any preview concern moves to S5. Note: this route was already flagged for S5 handoff prior to this ADR; BD codifies the handoff. |
| 1461–1472 | `session_status` | reads `session.get("config") or {}` and `logos = config.get("logos") or {}` plus `configVersion` from the session doc | **Refactor** — drop `logos` from the response (per OQ-BD-2 resolution). `configVersion` also drops: not on the session doc by default, and the status response does not need it. Status response shrinks to lifecycle fields only (`status`, `phase`, timestamps, agent pointer, `factoryRunId`, `projectId`, `outputUrls`, `qcResult`). |
| 1987–2001 | `session_history` | reads `cfg = session.get("config") or {}` and `cfg.get("brand", "")` for the summary | **Refactor-to-S2-API-call** — history view fetches the latest config from S2. If version-pinned history is needed, call `GET /v1/config/{sessionId}/versions` (S2) and per-version `GET /v1/config/{sessionId}?version=N`. History is a cold path — N+1 acceptable. |
| 2055–2065 | `list_sessions` | same brand/market/insuranceLine-from-session-doc pattern as `session.list_recent_sessions` | **Delete from S1 (identity-field extraction)** — list response returns lifecycle-only `SessionSummary` rows: `{sessionId, status, phase, createdAt, updatedAt, managedSessionId?, factoryRunId?, projectId?}`. Consumers that want `brand/market/shortcode` call S2 per session (N+1) or fan out client-side. S2 batch-get remains a deferred ask (§6.1). | <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 3.3 `tools/demo-studio-v3/factory_bridge.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

| Line | Code | Shape | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 33–129 | `map_config_to_factory_params(config)` | 90+ LOC that reads `config.brand`, `config.insuranceLine`, `config.hubspotDealId`, `config.colors.*`, `config.logos.*`, `config.persona`, `config.passFields.*`, `config.journeySteps`, `config.tokenUi`, `config.googleWallet` — entire config → factory params mapping | **Delete from S1** — OQ-BD-6 resolution confirms S3 `/build` takes `{sessionId}` only. S3 fetches config from S2 itself. S1 does no translation. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| 142–190 | `_build_content_from_config(config, params)` | builds `content` dict that factory modules expect from mapped params | **Delete from S1** — same reason. Second translation layer; belongs in S3 behind its `{sessionId}`-only contract. |
| 202 | `trigger_factory(session_id)` | `session = get_session(session_id)` | **Refactor** — stays; S1 reads its own session for lifecycle purposes (`status`, `factoryVersion`, writing `factoryRunId`). |
| 209 | `trigger_factory` | `config = session.get("config", {})` | **Delete from S1** — S1 does not fetch config before calling S3. Per OQ-BD-6, S1's call to S3 is `POST /build {sessionId}` and S3 fetches from S2 itself. No `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config` on the factory path. |
| 210–211 | `trigger_factory` | `factory_params = map_config_to_factory_params(config); content = _build_content_from_config(config, factory_params)` | **Delete from S1** — factory call becomes a thin `POST /build {sessionId}` (no `configVersion`, no translated payload). S3 handles the rest. |
| 250, 253 | `trigger_factory` | `logos = config.get("logos", {})`, `bg_color = config.get("colors", {}).get("primary", ...)` | **Delete from S1** — no config read on the factory path at all. If S1 needs visual context for, e.g., a Slack notification, fetch from S2 (`config_mgmt_client.fetch_config`) on the notification code path — not the build path. |

### 3.4 `tools/demo-studio-v3/factory_bridge_v2.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

| Line | Code | Shape | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 35–63 | `prepare_demo_dict(config)` | deep-copy config + default-fill `languages/params/translations/card/journey/demoSteps`, merge persona into params | **Delete from S1** — OQ-BD-6 resolution: S3 takes `{sessionId}` only; all translation deletes from S1. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| 75 | `trigger_factory_v2(session_id)` | `session = get_session(session_id)` | **Refactor** — keep for lifecycle fields |
| 82 | `trigger_factory_v2` | `config = session.get("config", {})` | **Delete from S1** — no config fetch on factory path (see §3.3 line 209). |
| 97, 109–115 | `validate(config)` via `factory_v2.validate_v2` | local config-schema validation (brand, persona, colors, journey required-field checks) | **Delete from S1** — validation is S2's job per the S2 spec's `POST /v1/config` contract. S1 trusts S2's validation and never runs its own. Delete `validate_v2.py` from S1 outright. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| 118 | `trigger_factory_v2` | `demo = prepare_demo_dict(config)` | **Delete from S1** |
| 140–143 | `trigger_factory_v2` | `logos = demo.get("logos", {})`, `bg_color = demo.get("colors", {}).get("primary", ...)` | **Delete from S1** |

### 3.5 `tools/demo-studio-v3/factory_v2/validate_v2.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

Entire file (73 LOC). Validates `brand`, `persona.{firstName,lastName}`, `colors.primary`, `journey[*].{name,triggerType,triggerEvent,triggerTiming,changeMessage}`. **Delete from S1.** Validation is S2's contract per `POST /v1/config`. <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 3.6 `tools/demo-studio-v3/preview.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

| Line | Code | Shape | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16–22 | `render_preview(config, config_version)` | takes a config dict + version, renders Jinja | **Delete from S1** — preview is S5 scope (iframe) per OQ-BD-3 resolution. S1 does not render previews. Entire `preview.py` file deletes from S1; its owning route (`main.py:1439–1445`) also deletes. | <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 3.7 `tools/demo-studio-v3/config_mgmt_client.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

Entire file (109 LOC) is the S1→S2 HTTP client. Currently **imported only by tests** — runtime code never calls it. Two specific concerns:

| Line | Function | Shape | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 71–79 | `fetch_schema()` | `GET /v1/schema` — well-aligned with S2 spec `getSchema` | **Keep** — canonical way S1 obtains the schema if needed. |
| 82–91 | `fetch_config(sid)` | `GET /v1/config/{session_id}` — well-aligned with S2 spec `getConfig` | **Keep** — this is the integration path §2 Rule 2 mandates. A `version: int \| None = None` query parameter is available for any caller that wants a pinned version; default latest. No build-path caller (per §5.3, S3 fetches its own config); remaining callers are render/history paths. |
| 94–108 | `patch_config(sid, path, value)` | sends `PATCH /v1/config/{session_id}` with `{updates: [{path, value}]}` | **Delete from S1** — OQ-BD-4 resolution: match S2's contract (no PATCH endpoint). `patch_config` is a phantom against `reference/2-config-mgmt.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec --> and is not called at runtime. Delete the function outright. If S2 ever ships PATCH, re-add with the then-specified shape. | <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 3.8 `tools/demo-studio-v3/sample-config.json` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

105 LOC. Pre-existing "Step 1 cleanup" test (`tests/test_no_local_validation.py:41-47` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os test file -->) already asserts this file must be deleted; Jayce never completed that cleanup. **Delete from S1.** The file is dead. <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 3.9 `tools/demo-studio-v3/dashboard_service.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

No config touches. Dashboard aggregates logs across services (`/logs` endpoints) only. **No change.**

### 3.10 `tools/demo-studio-v3/phase.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

No config touches — only reads/writes `phase` field. `phase` is a session-lifecycle field. **No change.**

### 3.11 `tools/demo-studio-v3/agent_proxy.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

No config touches. **No change.**

### 3.12 `tools/demo-studio-v3/logo_upload.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

Uploads image bytes to Wallet Studio; returns CDN URL. The caller (agent, via `set_config`) is responsible for persisting that URL into the config on S2. S1 itself never writes `logos` to a session doc. **No change.**

### 3.13 `tools/demo-studio-v3/setup_agent.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file; all §3 sub-section file paths are in missmp/company-os --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

System-prompt refers to `set_config`, `get_config`, `get_schema` MCP tools that target S2 directly. Not a config touchpoint in S1 runtime. **No change.**

## 4. S1 → S2 call shapes

All calls go through `config_mgmt_client.py`. Every call is Bearer-token authenticated via `CONFIG_MGMT_TOKEN` (shared secret, already configured — see session-state ADR §8 non-goals). Error mapping already exists in the client (`ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `UnauthorizedError`, `NetworkError`). <!-- orianna: ok -->

### 4.1 Fetch config for render/history

- **S2 endpoint:** `GET /v1/config/{session_id}` — operationId `getConfig`.
- **Query:** `version` (int, optional). Omitted = latest.
- **Request body:** none.
- **Response body:** `ConfigResponse` = `{ sessionId, config: DemoConfig, version, updatedAt }`.
- **Call sites in S1:** `main.session_page` (title derivation), `main.chat` (lazy-create title), `main.session_status` (if any identity field still surfaces — see §5.5), `main.session_history` (brand for summary). **Not** called on the factory path (OQ-BD-6: S3 fetches its own config). **Not** called for preview (OQ-BD-3: preview is S5). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Error handling:** on `NotFoundError` (S2 404), render the cold-session fallback (`brand = "New Session"`). Cold state is expected at session creation because S1 does not POST the first version — the first version appears when the agent's first `set_config` lands.

### 4.2 Create initial config at session creation — REMOVED

Per OQ-BD-5 resolution (c), S1 does **not** POST to S2 at session creation. The first config version is created by the managed agent via its first `set_config` MCP call. `configVersion` for the session lives on S2 from that point on. Prior to that call, there is no config for the session. S1 session creation is a single Firestore write; no outbound HTTP to S2.

### 4.3 Fetch schema for setup / history

- **S2 endpoint:** `GET /v1/schema` — operationId `getSchema`.
- **Call sites in S1:** none in the runtime today. Client method `fetch_schema()` stays available for future server-side schema-aware rendering; preview rendering specifically is S5.

### 4.4 List config versions for history view

- **S2 endpoint:** `GET /v1/config/{session_id}/versions` — operationId `listConfigVersions`.
- **Call sites in S1:** `main.session_history` (optional — version audit trail). Current code does not expose version history; session-state ADR §5 row 11 flagged history alignment as an SE.F follow-up.

## 5. Call-site transition detail

### 5.1 Session creation

Current (pseudo):
```
POST /session/new (S1)
  └── create_session(..., initial_context=SAMPLE_CONFIG + body fields)
      └── Firestore write: {sessionId, config: {...}, configVersion: 1, ...}
```

Target (post-BD, per OQ-BD-5 resolution (c)):
```
POST /session/new (S1)
  └── session_store.create_session(slack*)
      └── Firestore write: {sessionId, status: "configuring", createdAt, updatedAt, ...}
         (no `config`, no `configVersion`, no `brand`/`market`/`languages`/`shortcode` persisted)
  └── managed_agent.boot(sessionId, brand, market, languages, shortcode, ...)    ← agent-init metadata
         (identity fields are passed to the agent so it boots with them; not persisted on S1)
  └── return {sessionId, studioUrl}
```

S1 does **not** POST to S2 at creation. The first `POST /v1/config` on S2 happens later, when the managed agent runs its first `set_config` MCP call — which goes directly to S2 via the MCP server, bypassing S1. From S1's perspective, a new session has no config until the agent chooses to write one.

Identity fields (`brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode`) are agent-input metadata — consumed by the managed agent to seed its reasoning context — and are not written to the S1 session doc. The exact agent-init message shape is Kayn's to refine in the SE.F.1 follow-up.

### 5.2 Chat / status / history / page render

Current: `session.get("config", ...)`.
Target: `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` — latest version.

Per-endpoint latency: one extra GET to S2 per render. For hot paths (status polling), consider a short-TTL in-process cache keyed by `sessionId` — an in-process dict with 30-second TTL is fine given single-instance Cloud Run.

### 5.3 Factory build — S1 becomes a thin pass-through

Current: `config = session.get("config", {})` followed by `map_config_to_factory_params(config)` and `_build_content_from_config(config, params)`.

Target (per OQ-BD-6 resolution, authoritative against `tools/demo-factory/api/factory.yaml:192` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec --> `required: [sessionId]`): <!-- orianna: ok -->

```
POST /session/{id}/build (S1)
  └── session_store.get_session(session_id)    # lifecycle-only; no config read
  └── session_store.transition_status(..., to="building")
  └── factory_client.start_build(session_id)   # POST /build {sessionId} to S3
         (no configVersion, no translated payload, no content dict)
  └── session_store.update_session(factoryRunId=...)
  └── return accepted
```

- **S3 spec cite:** `tools/demo-factory/api/factory.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec --> lines 186–203 define the `/build` POST body as `required: [sessionId]` with an optional `configVersion`. Per Duong's OQ-BD-6 resolution ("Factory always reads the latest version"), S1 supplies `{sessionId}` only; S3 fetches the latest config from S2 itself. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **All translation deletes:** `map_config_to_factory_params`, `_build_content_from_config`, `prepare_demo_dict`, `validate_v2.py`, and every factory-path config read in `factory_bridge.py` / `factory_bridge_v2.py` delete from S1. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Build reproducibility** is no longer an S1 concern. If S3 needs version pinning for reproducibility it handles it via its own `configVersion` parameter against S2.

### 5.4 `cancel-build`, `complete`, `close`

None of these read config. All three stay as-is from session-state-ADR §5 perspective. No boundary-impact.

### 5.5 `GET /sessions` and `GET /session/{id}/status`

Per OQ-BD-1 resolution (strict), the S1 session doc does **not** hold `brand`, `market`, `languages`, or `shortcode`. Resolution:

- **A. Accept N+1 — ACCEPTED.** Any consumer of `/sessions` that needs identity fields fans out to S2 per session. Default page size = 20 → 20 S2 calls on top of the S1 list. N+1 is accepted for now. S2 batch-get (`GET /v1/configs?sessionIds=...`) remains a deferred ask — see §6.1.
- **B. Denormalise onto S1 — REJECTED.** Violates Rule 2 and BD-1.
- **C. Drop identity fields from S1's response shape — ADOPTED.** `GET /sessions` returns lifecycle-only `SessionSummary` rows: `{sessionId, status, phase, createdAt, updatedAt, managedSessionId?, factoryRunId?, projectId?}`.

**Consequence for `GET /session/{id}/status`:** response shape shrinks — no `logos` (per OQ-BD-2), no `configVersion` (not on session doc), no `brand`/`market`. Status is strictly lifecycle: `{status, phase, createdAt, updatedAt, managedSessionId?, factoryRunId?, projectId?, outputUrls?, qcResult?}`. UI code that wants identity context issues a parallel `GET /v1/config/{sessionId}` to S2.

## 6. S2 capability gaps — blockers

### 6.1 No list endpoint on S2

S2 exposes `GET /v1/config/{session_id}` (one session) and `GET /v1/config/{session_id}/versions` (one session's history), but **no `GET /v1/configs?sessionIds=...`** or equivalent batch endpoint. Without it, S1's `GET /sessions` must either N+1 (option A above) or denormalise (option B). Recommendation for S2 team: add `GET /v1/configs?sessionIds=id1,id2,...` or `POST /v1/configs:batch-get`. Not blocking option B.

### 6.2 No PATCH on S2 — RESOLVED

Per OQ-BD-4 resolution, `config_mgmt_client.patch_config` deletes from S1 outright. S2's contract is full-snapshot via `POST /v1/config` with immutable versioning; there is no PATCH endpoint and none is being requested.

### 6.3 No S2 → S1 change-notification channel — NOT APPLICABLE

Under BD-1 strict, S1 does not denormalise any config-shaped fields, so there is nothing on S1 to keep in sync. S2 change-notification is unnecessary from S1's side.

## 7. Sequencing vs. the session-state-encapsulation ADR

| This ADR (BD) | Session-state ADR (SE) | Ordering |
|---|---|---|
| BD.decide (this ADR) | SE.0, SE.A (audit + additive module) | Parallel — SE.A is purely additive storage plumbing; this ADR decides what data flows through it. |
| BD.implement: delete config writes in `session.py::create_session` | SE.A.4 (implement `session_store.create_session`) | **BD implementation must land INSIDE SE.A.4.** |
| BD.implement: delete `SAMPLE_CONFIG` + UI/internal create-session config plumbing in `main.py` | SE.B.2 (migrate `main.py` call sites) | **BD must land BEFORE SE.B.2.** | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.implement: delete `map_config_to_factory_params`, `_build_content_from_config`, `prepare_demo_dict`, `validate_v2.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/factory_v2/ --> | SE.B.4 (migrate `factory_bridge*.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file glob under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ -->) | **BD must land BEFORE SE.B.4.** | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.implement: add `config_mgmt_client` call sites for `preview` / `session_status` / `session_history` | SE.B.2 (same file) | **Parallelisable with SE.B.2.** |
| BD.implement: extend SE.E grep gate with config-boundary patterns | SE.E.2 (implement grep-gate CI) | **BD must land INSIDE SE.E.2.** |
| BD.implement: delete `sample-config.json` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ --> | SE.* (unrelated) | Any time. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.implement: initial config POST to S2 at session creation | SE.F.1 (`/session/new` spec alignment) | **Parallelisable.** |
| BD.implement: identity-field denormalisation (brand/market/languages/shortcode) | SE.A.4 / SE.A.6 (`session_store` fields) | **BD must land INSIDE SE.A.4.** |

**Verdict (per OQ-BD-7 resolution):** BD lands before SE.B.2 and SE.B.4. SE.A is additive and may proceed in parallel.
- **SE.0, SE.A.1–A.3:** independent of this ADR, can land first.
- **SE.A.4 onward:** must absorb BD changes. The SE dataclass no longer carries `brand/market/languages/shortcode`; amendment file spells out the new shape. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **SE.B.2, SE.B.4:** must land with BD changes, not without.
- **SE.C (enum migration):** independent — this ADR does not touch the status enum.
- **SE.D (token TTL):** independent — tokens are not config.
- **SE.E.2:** must absorb BD grep-gate patterns.

## 8. Migration / rollback posture

### 8.1 In-flight sessions with embedded config

At migration time, the `demo-studio-sessions` collection has live rows with `config: {...}` and `configVersion: N` embedded. Options:

- **A. Backfill — copy each session's `config` to S2 as version 1.** A one-shot script iterates `demo-studio-sessions`, for each row calls `POST /v1/config` with `author: "backfill"`, captures the returned `version`, writes that version back to the S1 doc, then deletes the embedded `config` field. Risk: the embedded configs may fail S2 validation (legacy fields like `insuranceLine`, or missing required fields like `ipadDemo`). Mitigation: run with `force=true` and record each backfilled session's validation errors for audit.
- **B. Orphan — do not backfill; treat embedded `config` as tombstoned.** All currently-configuring sessions complete on the old path (pre-migration code still deployed as canary) or are cancelled. New sessions use the new path. Risk: any user with a session open at cutover has to restart. Given the low session volume today, this is the simpler option.
- **C. Lazy backfill — on-demand.** Deploy new code; on any request that reads config for a session that has embedded `config` and no S2 version, synthesise an S2 version via `POST /v1/config` then proceed. Risk: complicates the read path indefinitely.

**Recommendation:** B (orphan). Run a pre-deploy query `SELECT count(*) FROM demo-studio-sessions WHERE status IN ('configuring', 'building')` — if the count is manageable (likely single digits given current traffic), hand-walk those users. Document in the deploy runbook.

### 8.2 Per-endpoint flip strategy

Phase each endpoint independently:
- `POST /session/new` — flip atomically. New sessions post-deploy use the new path. No outbound S2 call at creation.
- `POST /session` (internal) — flip atomically. Same reasoning.
- `GET /session/{id}/preview` — **deletes** as an S1 route (OQ-BD-3). Traffic redirect/410 handling is an S5 concern.
- `GET /session/{id}/status`, `/history`, `/session/{id}` (page) — flip atomically per deploy. Read paths tolerate S2-fetch or fall back to "New Session" on S2 404 / 5xx.
- `POST /session/{id}/build` — flip atomically to the thin `POST /build {sessionId}` pass-through. S3 is already contract-aligned on `{sessionId}` per `tools/demo-factory/api/factory.yaml:192` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec --> (§5.3), so no S3-side coordination is strictly required for payload compatibility — only confirmation that S3's self-fetch path is live. Sona to confirm with S3 team before flip. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- `POST /session/{id}/approve` — scheduled for delete per SE.B.8; BD does not change that posture.

### 8.3 Rollback

Per-phase revert is straight git revert, same as session-state ADR §7. Because BD-1 strict means identity fields never landed on the session doc post-migration, rollback doesn't conflict with existing writes — there's nothing to "un-populate".

## 9. Consequences

- **S1 shrinks — significantly more than the previous draft.** ~150+ LOC from `SAMPLE_CONFIG` + `map_config_to_factory_params` + `_build_content_from_config` + `prepare_demo_dict` + `validate_v2.py` + `sample-config.json`, plus `preview.py` + the `/preview` route, plus `patch_config`. Estimated total deletion: >250 LOC. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Read-path latency increases by one S2 GET per render** (only where identity fields are needed: `session_page` title, `chat` lazy-create title, `session_history` summary). Mitigated by in-process short-TTL cache on hot paths.
- **S2 becomes a hard runtime dependency for S1 UI renders that include identity fields.** Today, S1 renders even if S2 is down (reads cached config out of session doc). Post-migration, those renders degrade to "New Session" fallback on S2 404 / 5xx. Acceptable per Duong's posture; S2 is infrastructure, not a soft dependency.
- **Factory builds are determinism-agnostic at the S1 boundary.** S1 does not capture `configVersion` at build start; S3's self-fetch reads latest. If build reproducibility is required, it's an S3 concern.
- **The MCP server is unchanged.** It already writes to S2 directly; S1 was never in that path.
- **Tests simplify.** `test_config_mgmt_client.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os test file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/tests/ --> tests become live-integration. `test_no_local_validation.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os test file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/tests/ --> finally passes without further action. ~15 call-sites stop mocking `session.get("config", ...)`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **SE ADR `Session` dataclass shrinks.** `brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode` drop. `configVersion` drops. See sibling amendment file.
- **`/preview` route goes away on S1.** S5 picks it up. Out of scope for this ADR; flagged for whoever owns S5.
- **No S2 writes from S1 at creation.** S1 becomes a pure session-lifecycle service + agent host. Every config mutation is agent-initiated via MCP → S2.

## 10. Non-goals (explicit)

- **NOT** changing S2. Every S2-side gap is flagged for the S2 team, not designed around.
- **NOT** redesigning the factory translation (`map_config_to_factory_params`). This ADR decides it leaves S1; where it lands on the S3 side is S3's ADR to write.
- **NOT** implementing anything. Per Azir boundaries — architecture-only, no code changes. Kayn/Aphelios decompose into tasks; Jayce/Viktor implement.
- **NOT** modifying the session-state ADR. Extensions only, via the amendments documented in §7.
- **NOT** redefining `configVersion` semantics. It remains a monotonic int pointer maintained by S2 and mirrored onto S1 post-write.

## 11. Resolutions (Duong, 2026-04-20 s3)

All seven open questions resolved. Revisions incorporated above; this section records the authoritative decisions and the sections amended per resolution.

- **OQ-BD-1 — RESOLVED: Strict.** No denormalisation. S1 session doc holds lifecycle fields only (`sessionId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `status`, `phase`, agent pointer, `factoryRunId`). `brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode` are NOT session-persisted — they are config/agent-input. Any consumer that needs identity fields (`/sessions` list, titles in `main.session_page` / `main.chat`, `main.session_history` summary) fetches from S2. N+1 is accepted for now; S2 batch-get remains a deferred ask (§6.1). Amended sections: §2 Rule 1, §3.14, §5.5, §6.1. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **OQ-BD-2 — RESOLVED: Drop.** `GET /session/{id}/status` no longer returns `logos`. Response shrinks to lifecycle-only (`sessionId`, `status`, `phase`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `factoryRunId?`). Aligns with session-state ADR SE.F.3 follow-up. Amended: §3.2 row 1461–1472, §3.14 Refactor entry for `session_status`.
- **OQ-BD-3 — RESOLVED: Out of scope for S1.** Preview is S5 (iframe; see `reference/5-preview.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec -->). S1 does not track `configVersion` for UI pinning. `configVersion` is not required on the S1 session doc and is removed. Amended: §3.1 `configVersion` write now in Delete list; §5.3 build trigger does not pin version. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **OQ-BD-4 — RESOLVED: Delete.** `config_mgmt_client.patch_config` removed. S2's contract is canonical: `POST /v1/config` full-snapshot with immutable monotonic versioning. Amended: §3.7 row 94–108 → Delete; §6.2.
- **OQ-BD-5 — RESOLVED: Option (c).** S1 does NOT `POST /v1/config` at session creation. `configVersion` is absent on the session doc; the first config version is produced by the agent's first `set_config` MCP tool call landing on S2. Amended: §4.2 ("REMOVED"), §5.1, §5.5.
- **OQ-BD-6 — RESOLVED: Confirmed from spec.** `reference/3-factory.yaml` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os reference spec --> `/build` requestBody schema is `{required: [sessionId]}`. Description: "Factory always reads the latest version; pinning to a historical version is out of scope." S1 passes only `sessionId` to S3. S3 self-fetches config from S2. All S1 translation code deletes. `trigger_factory*` reduces to: read session → `POST /build {sessionId}` → persist `factoryRunId`. Amended: §3.3, §3.4, §3.5, §3.14, §5.3. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **OQ-BD-7 — RESOLVED: Confirmed.** BD lands before SE.B.2 and SE.B.4. SE.A is additive and proceeds in parallel. SE.B call-site migrations must see the post-BD shape. Amended: §7 sequencing table stands.

**Net scope redefinition (Duong, verbatim):** "we only care about creation of the config and manage sessions of the managed agent." Interpretation locked in: S1 = (a) host the Anthropic managed agent, (b) track the agent's session lifecycle, (c) forward requests to/from the agent. Nothing else. The §3.14 delete list (17 rows) executes this scope.

**See also:** `company-os/plans/2026-04-20-session-state-encapsulation-bd-amendment.md` <!-- orianna: ok — cross-repo amendment; lives in missmp/company-os --> — companion amendment that names the session-state ADR sections and tasks that change as a consequence of these resolutions. <!-- orianna: ok -->

## 12. Handoff

- **Kayn / Aphelios:** decompose §7 amendments into new `SE.A.4b`, `SE.A.13`, `SE.B.2b`, `SE.B.4b`, `SE.B.9`, `SE.E.2b` tasks (or renumber as appropriate). Do not promote to tasks until OQ-BD-1, -4, -5, -6, -7 are resolved. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Orianna:** fact-check the 15-path enumeration in §3 against `feat/demo-studio-v3@d327581`. Line numbers drift; rebaseline on task-file promotion. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Sona:** coordinate OQ-BD-6 with the S3 team, and surface §6.1 (batch GET), §6.2 (PATCH fate), §6.3 (change notifications) to the S2 team.
- **Camille:** owns the SE.E grep gate; will absorb the two extra patterns from §2 Rule 4 when SE.E.2 is decomposed.
- **Jayce / Viktor:** no action yet — plan only. Once tasks land, the deletion work (per §3) is a week or two of mostly-mechanical surgery across `main.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ -->, `factory_bridge*.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file glob under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ -->, `session.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ -->, `factory_v2/` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os directory under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/ -->. <!-- orianna: ok -->

## Test plan

Enforcement is structural and gate-based rather than runtime; per ADR §2 Rule 4 and the SE.E grep gate:

- **I1 — Config-boundary gate:** the extended SE.E.2 grep gate asserts no file under `company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/` <!-- orianna: ok — grep-gate scope string referring to missmp/company-os; not a local filesystem path --> (other than tests and migration scripts) reads or writes `session["config"]` or holds the literal `insuranceLine`; CI fails on any violation. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **I2 — Identity-field exclusion:** SE.A.3/A.4 tests (in the session-state ADR) assert the Firestore write payload for `create_session` contains no `brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode`, or `configVersion` keys; `update_session` rejects those names as unknown fields.
- **I3 — Factory pass-through shape:** SE.B.4 regression tests assert `trigger_factory*` functions no longer call `map_config_to_factory_params`, `_build_content_from_config`, or `prepare_demo_dict`, and that the outbound S3 call carries `{sessionId}` only.
- **I4 — Deleted symbols absent:** SE.B.4 acceptance criteria assert `validate_v2.py` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/factory_v2/; deletion acceptance criterion --> and `sample-config.json` <!-- orianna: ok — company-os file under missmp/company-os/tools/demo-studio-v3/; deletion acceptance criterion --> no longer exist in the repo after the deletion PR merges. <!-- orianna: ok -->

## Tasks

_Source: `company-os/plans/2026-04-20-s1-s2-service-boundary-tasks.md` in `missmp/company-os`. Inlined verbatim._ <!-- orianna: ok — cross-repo task file; inlined per §D3 one-plan-one-file rule --> <!-- orianna: ok -->

# Task breakdown — S1/S2 Service Boundary (BD)

Source ADR: `plans/approved/work/2026-04-20-s1-s2-service-boundary.md` (§1–§12, all seven OQs RESOLVED, Orianna-signed 2026-04-21). <!-- orianna: ok -->

Branch: `feat/demo-studio-v3` (company-os worktree at `~/Documents/Work/mmp/workspace/company-os-demo-studio-v3`). Same branch as SE / MAL / MAD — four ADRs share one PR branch per §11 / §12 handoff notes. <!-- orianna: ok -->

Task-ID scheme: `BD.<phase>.<n>`. Phases track the ADR's deletion/refactor structure (§3 + §5) and the grep-gate extension (§2 Rule 4), not file-by-file. Every impl task is preceded by an xfail TEST commit on the same branch per Rule 12.

AI-minute estimates are wall-clock Sonnet-builder time per commit (test and impl commits counted separately). Estimates exclude Aphelios breakdown + Senna review time.

## Cross-ADR dependency map (load-bearing — read first)

BD's execution is tightly interlocked with three sibling ADRs living on the same branch. As of 2026-04-21: BD is **approved + signed**; MAD is **approved + decomposed**; MAL and SE are **approved, decomposing now** (Kayn in parallel). Hard ordering from ADR §7 stands.

| BD phase | SE task it touches | Ordering rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BD.A (pre-delete audit) | — | Must precede BD.B.* (needs live line-number rebaseline vs. HEAD of branch). |
| BD.B.1 (delete `SAMPLE_CONFIG` + `main.py` session-creation config plumbing) | **must land BEFORE SE.B.2** | SE.B.2 migrates the same call sites; landing BD after forces rework. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.B.2 (delete embedded `config` / `configVersion` writes from `session.create_session`) | **must land INSIDE SE.A.4** | SE.A.4 is where `session_store.create_session` is implemented — BD shapes its signature (no `brand/market/languages/shortcode/configVersion`). | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.B.3 (delete `map_config_to_factory_params` + `_build_content_from_config` + `validate_v2.py`) | **must land BEFORE SE.B.4** | SE.B.4 migrates `factory_bridge*.py`; BD deletions land first, SE.B.4 migrates the shrunken surface. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.B.4 (delete `factory_bridge_v2.prepare_demo_dict` + factory-path config-fetches) | **must land BEFORE SE.B.4** | Same reasoning. |
| BD.C.* (refactor: S2-fetch on render/history/status paths) | **parallelisable with SE.B.2** | Distinct call sites; no collision as long as BD.B.1 lands first. |
| BD.D (delete `config_mgmt_client.patch_config` + `sample-config.json`) | independent of SE | Any wave. | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.E (grep-gate extension — two new patterns) | **must land INSIDE SE.E.2** | SE.E.2 is the grep-gate CI step; BD.E contributes two additional patterns + allowlist entries. Coordinate with Camille (SE.E owner). |
| BD.F (thin `POST /build {sessionId}` pass-through) | SE.B.4 shares `trigger_factory` scaffold | **Parallelisable with SE.B.4** after BD.B.3/B.4 land. Confirm S3 self-fetch live (per ADR §8.2) before merging. |
| BD.G (agent-init refactor: identity-only payload to managed agent) | SE.F.1 | **Parallelisable with SE.F.1.** Exact shape is Kayn's to refine in SE.F.1 follow-up (ADR §5.1). BD.G ships the minimal "strip full config, send identity four" change. |

**Cross-ADR task handoffs recorded:**
- **BD.E.2 ↔ SE.E.2** — the two grep-gate regex patterns from ADR §2 Rule 4 (`session\[?["\']config["\']\]?\s*=` and literal `insuranceLine`) must be committed to the SE.E.2 gate config, NOT a separate BD-only gate. Camille owns the gate file; BD.E.2 is an amendment PR on top of SE.E.2.
- **BD.E.3 ↔ MAD.E.1** — the MAD dashboard list handler is on BD §3.14 allowlist (an allowed caller of `config_mgmt_client`). MAD.E.1 (Kayn's breakdown) verifies the allowlist entry exists. BD.E.3 adds the entry to the gate config; MAD.E.1 confirms.
- **BD.B.2 ↔ SE.A.4** — BD.B.2 is a commit **inside** the SE.A.4 branch of work (not a separate PR). The SE.A.4 task body changes shape because of BD: `session_store.create_session(...)` has NO `brand`, NO `market`, NO `languages`, NO `shortcode`, NO `configVersion`, NO `config` params. Kayn must amend SE.A.4 in the SE task file (if already decomposed) or see this constraint when decomposing.

## Phase summary & estimates

| Phase | Scope | Tasks | AI-min |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BD.0 | Preflight: line-number rebaseline + worktree check | 2 | 20 |
| BD.A | Deletion manifest + coverage map (audit errand) | 2 | 30 |
| BD.B | Delete-from-S1 (session-creation + factory-translation families) | 8 (4 xfail + 4 impl) | 240 |

| BD.D | Delete config-client leftovers (`patch_config` + `sample-config.json`) | 2 (1 xfail + 1 impl) | 35 | <!-- orianna: ok -->
| BD.E | Grep-gate extension (two patterns + allowlist) | 4 (1 xfail + 2 impl + 1 errand) | 90 |
| BD.F | Factory path: thin `POST /build {sessionId}` pass-through | 2 (1 xfail + 1 impl) | 55 |
| BD.G | Agent-init refactor: identity-only payload | 2 (1 xfail + 1 impl) | 50 |

| **TOTAL** | | **29** | **720** |

Rough wave diagram (serial `→`, parallel within wave `∥`):

```
Wave 0: BD.0.1 → BD.0.2
Wave 1: BD.A.1 → BD.A.2
Wave 2: BD.B.1 (xfail) → BD.B.2 (impl) ∥ BD.B.3 (xfail) → BD.B.4 (impl)   [main.py session-create]
        BD.B.5 (xfail) → BD.B.6 (impl) ∥ BD.B.7 (xfail) → BD.B.8 (impl)   [factory-translation delete]
Wave 3: BD.C.1 → BD.C.2 ∥ BD.C.3 → BD.C.4 ∥ BD.C.5 → BD.C.6               [refactor render/status/history]
Wave 4: BD.D.1 → BD.D.2
Wave 5: BD.E.1 → BD.E.2 ∥ BD.E.3 → BD.E.4
Wave 6: BD.F.1 → BD.F.2
Wave 7: BD.G.1 → BD.G.2
Wave 8: BD.H.1
```

Waves 2 and 3 can overlap if the session-create and factory-translation call sites are disjoint (they are — see §3.1/§3.2 vs. §3.3/§3.4). Waves 5/6/7 can interleave with Wave 3 if capacity allows; dispatch at Sona's discretion.

---

## Phase BD.0 — Preflight

### BD.0.1 — Line-number rebaseline against branch HEAD (ERRAND)
- **What:** ADR §3 line numbers are pinned to `feat/demo-studio-v3@d327581`. On start, rebaseline against current branch HEAD and append a "BD.0.1 result" table to this file mapping each §3 row to its current line number. Flag any row whose shape changed (e.g. an insert pushed the `config` write to a new wrapper function). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Deliverable:** table with columns `ADR §3 row | file | ADR-cited line | current line | drift? (y/n) | notes`.
- **Acceptance:** Aphelios/Sona can read the table and confirm zero-drift or queue an ADR line-number patch.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **AI-min:** 15.

### BD.0.2 — Worktree hygiene (ERRAND)
- **What:** confirm `~/Documents/Work/mmp/workspace/company-os-demo-studio-v3` is on `feat/demo-studio-v3` and clean. If absent, `git worktree add` it (raw — company-os has no `safe-checkout.sh`). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** `git -C ~/Documents/Work/mmp/workspace/company-os-demo-studio-v3 status` clean on `feat/demo-studio-v3`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Blockers:** none.
- **AI-min:** 5.

---

## Phase BD.A — Deletion manifest + coverage map (audit)

### BD.A.1 — Build deletion manifest from §3.14 (ERRAND)
- **What:** produce `tools/demo-studio-v3/tests/fixtures/bd_deletion_manifest.json` listing every (file, symbol, line range) in ADR §3.14's 17-row Delete list. One object per entry: `{file, symbol, startLine, endLine, adrRef, replacement}`. Used by BD.H.1 as the sentinel-assertion input, and by Senna as the PR-review checklist. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** 17 entries; each line range validated against BD.0.1 rebaseline; each `adrRef` points to a §3.x row.
- **Blockers:** BD.0.1.
- **AI-min:** 20.

### BD.A.2 — Map current test coverage to §3.14 rows (ERRAND)
- **What:** grep `tools/demo-studio-v3/tests/` for references to every symbol on the delete list. Produce `bd_test_coverage_map.md` noting which delete-rows currently have tests, which tests must be deleted (those asserting the behaviour we're removing), which tests must be rewritten (those asserting the S2-fetch behaviour we're adding). Flag `tests/test_no_local_validation.py:41-47` as pre-existing xfail that will flip green post-BD (see ADR §3.8, §9). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** map covers all 17 delete rows + all 5 refactor rows + all 3 keep rows.
- **Blockers:** BD.A.1.
- **AI-min:** 10.

---

## Phase BD.B — Delete-from-S1

Covers the 11 delete-rows in §3.14 that are session-creation + factory-translation surgery. The remaining delete-rows land in BD.D (client leftover) or are covered by the refactor tasks (BD.C) after the delete portion lands.

### BD.B.1 — xfail: `main.py` session-creation config plumbing gone (TEST) <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **What:** add `tests/test_main_session_create_no_config.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `main.SAMPLE_CONFIG` attribute does not exist (module-level deletion).
  2. `POST /session/new` (UI variant) with a body that includes `insuranceLine` rejects the field (422) OR silently drops it — matches chosen behaviour in §3.2 row 1192 / §5.1 (rejects, since `insuranceLine` is not in any schema S1 owns post-BD).
  3. `POST /session/new` flow: the Firestore write payload contains NO `config`, NO `configVersion`, NO `brand`/`market`/`languages`/`shortcode` keys (identity fields are agent-input only).
  4. Internal `POST /session` variant: same assertions.
  5. `main.create_new_session_ui` no longer calls `create_session(initial_context=...)` — either the kwarg is gone from the call, or the function signature itself has dropped it (paired w/ SE.A.4).
- **Acceptance:** all xfail strict. Test file references `plans/approved/work/2026-04-20-s1-s2-service-boundary.md §3.2`. <!-- orianna: ok — future plan location; currently in proposed/work/ during re-sign -->
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for main.py session-create config-plumbing deletion (BD.B.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 30.

### BD.B.2 — impl: delete `SAMPLE_CONFIG` + session-create config plumbing in `main.py` (BUILDER) <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **What:** execute ADR §3.2 rows 53 / 1190 / 1192 / 1196–1201 / 1250–1254 deletions. Concretely:
  - Remove `SAMPLE_CONFIG: dict = {}` module-level (line 53).
  - In `create_new_session_ui` and `create_new_session` (internal): remove `initial_context = json.loads(json.dumps(SAMPLE_CONFIG))` deep-copy; remove `initial_context["insuranceLine"] = ...`; remove the `initial_context=initial_context` kwarg on `create_session(...)`; the body is reduced to the lifecycle-only fields.
  - Session create call becomes `session_store.create_session(session_id=..., slack_user_id=..., slack_thread_ts=..., factory_version=...)` — no config, no identity fields. (If SE.A.4 not yet landed, inline-adapt to current `create_session` signature and note in PR description that BD.B.2 absorbs into SE.A.4 on merge.)
  - Body-model for `POST /session/new`: drop `insuranceLine` field from the Pydantic body class. Keep `brand`, `market`, `languages`, `shortcode` on the request body (they're agent-input, consumed by the `managed_agent.boot(...)` call — BD.G handles that refactor). Add field-level assertion to reject `insuranceLine`.
- **Acceptance:** BD.B.1 tests pass. Pre-existing green tests that depend on `SAMPLE_CONFIG` being readable fail — expected, they're on BD.A.2's "must delete" list.
- **Depends on:** BD.B.1. Coordinates with SE.A.4.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): delete SAMPLE_CONFIG + session-create config plumbing (BD.B.2)`.
- **AI-min:** 40.

### BD.B.3 — xfail: `session.py::create_session` no config/configVersion write (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_session_store_no_config_write.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `create_session(...)` (or `session_store.create_session` if SE.A.4 landed) writes a Firestore document whose keys are the lifecycle set only (no `config`, no `configVersion`, no `brand`/`market`/`languages`/`shortcode`).
  2. `_UPDATABLE_FIELDS` allowlist (§3.1 line 133) is unchanged, but the test asserts `"config"`, `"configVersion"`, `"brand"`, `"market"`, `"languages"`, `"shortcode"` are NOT in the allowlist — regression guard against future re-adds.
  3. `list_recent_sessions(...)` response rows contain lifecycle-only keys: `{sessionId, status, phase, createdAt, updatedAt, managedSessionId?, factoryRunId?, projectId?}`. No `brand` / `market` / `insuranceLine` keys (§3.1 rows 118–128).
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for session.py config/identity-field exclusion (BD.B.3)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

### BD.B.4 — impl: delete `config`/`configVersion` writes + identity-field extraction in `session.py` (BUILDER) <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **What:** execute ADR §3.1 rows 42 / 43 / 118–128.
  - Remove `"config": initial_context or {}` from `create_session` Firestore write.
  - Remove `"configVersion": 1` write.
  - Rewrite `list_recent_sessions(...)` to return lifecycle-only `SessionSummary` rows (no `brand`/`market`/`insuranceLine` reads).
  - `_UPDATABLE_FIELDS` unchanged.
- **Acceptance:** BD.B.3 tests pass. This task's impl lands INSIDE the SE.A.4 commit if SE.A.4 hasn't landed yet (co-author with Kayn); otherwise as a follow-up commit on top of SE.A.4.
- **Depends on:** BD.B.3. Coordinates with SE.A.4.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): delete config/configVersion writes + identity-field extraction in session.py (BD.B.4)`.
- **AI-min:** 35.

### BD.B.5 — xfail: factory_bridge translation functions gone (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_factory_bridge_no_translation.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. Importing `map_config_to_factory_params` from `tools.demo_studio_v3.factory_bridge` raises `ImportError` (symbol deleted).
  2. Importing `_build_content_from_config` from same raises `ImportError`.
  3. Importing `prepare_demo_dict` from `tools.demo_studio_v3.factory_bridge_v2` raises `ImportError`.
  4. Module `tools.demo_studio_v3.factory_v2.validate_v2` does not exist (ModuleNotFoundError).
  5. `trigger_factory(session_id)` function still exists but reduces to: read session, POST to S3 with `{sessionId}` only, persist `factoryRunId`. Mocks `factory_client.start_build` and asserts it's called with `{"sessionId": "sess_..."}` exactly (no `configVersion`, no translated payload). (Impl of the thin pass-through is BD.F; this xfail scopes only the deletion shape.)
  6. `trigger_factory_v2(session_id)` same shape.
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for factory-translation deletion (BD.B.5)`.
- **AI-min:** 30.

### BD.B.6 — impl: delete factory-translation families (BUILDER)
- **What:** execute ADR §3.3 rows 33–129 / 142–190 / 209 / 210–211 / 250/253 and §3.4 rows 35–63 / 82 / 97/109–115 / 118 / 140–143 and §3.5 entire file.
  - Delete `map_config_to_factory_params` from `factory_bridge.py`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Delete `_build_content_from_config` from `factory_bridge.py`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Delete `prepare_demo_dict` from `factory_bridge_v2.py`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Delete `factory_v2/validate_v2.py` (entire file). <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Inside `trigger_factory` and `trigger_factory_v2`: remove `config = session.get("config", {})`, remove translation calls, remove `logos/bg_color` reads. Leave the function bodies as scaffold (read session → call factory_client → persist factoryRunId — actual thin pass-through body is BD.F.2 once the factory_client method exists). <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Remove any imports that become unused.
- **Acceptance:** BD.B.5 items 1–4 green. Items 5–6 still xfail (body filled in BD.F.2). `tests/test_no_local_validation.py` moves from xfail → pass (pre-existing Jayce-unfinished test, per ADR §3.8). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Depends on:** BD.B.5.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): delete factory-param translation + validate_v2 (BD.B.6)`.
- **AI-min:** 45.

### BD.B.7 — xfail: preview route + preview.py gone from S1 (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_preview_deleted_from_s1.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `GET /session/{id}/preview` returns 404 (route unregistered) — NOT 200 with a rendered preview.
  2. `tools.demo_studio_v3.preview` module does not exist (ModuleNotFoundError) — file deleted. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  3. `main.render_preview` symbol not imported.
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict. Per ADR §8.2, traffic redirect/410 handling for the deleted route is S5's concern and out of scope here.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for S1 preview deletion (BD.B.7)`.
- **AI-min:** 15.

### BD.B.8 — impl: delete `/preview` route + `preview.py` from S1 (BUILDER) <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **What:** execute ADR §3.2 row 1439–1445 (route) + §3.6 (file).
  - Remove route registration for `GET /session/{id}/preview` in `main.py`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Delete `tools/demo-studio-v3/preview.py` entirely. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Remove any imports of `render_preview` / `preview` from `main.py`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** BD.B.7 tests pass.
- **Depends on:** BD.B.7.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): delete /preview route + preview.py from S1 (BD.B.8)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

---

## Phase BD.C — Refactor-in-S1 (render/status/history S2-fetch call sites)

Covers the 5 refactor-rows in §3.14 that stay on S1 but rewrite to fetch from S2.

### BD.C.1 — xfail: `session_page` title S2-fetch + cold-session fallback (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_session_page_title_s2_fetch.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `GET /session/{id}` renders page; under the hood, `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` is called once; `<title>` contains the returned `config.brand`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  2. On S2 404 (cold session, no first `set_config` yet): `<title>` contains `"New Session"` fallback; no error log emitted.
  3. On S2 5xx: `<title>` contains `"New Session"` fallback; error log emitted at WARN with key `s2_render_fetch_failed`.
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for session_page S2-fetch title (BD.C.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

### BD.C.2 — impl: session_page title via S2 fetch (BUILDER)
- **What:** execute ADR §3.2 row 1349 refactor. Replace `session.get("config", {}).get("brand", "New Session")` with `await config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` and pull `config.brand`. Wrap in try/except for `NotFoundError` (cold) and generic exception (5xx) — both fall back to `"New Session"`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** BD.C.1 tests pass.
- **Depends on:** BD.C.1.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): session_page title via S2 fetch (BD.C.2)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

### BD.C.3 — xfail: `chat` lazy-create title via S2; insuranceLine gone (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_chat_lazy_create_title_s2.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. On lazy managed-session create (§3.2 row 1395–1397), `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` is called; agent title derived from `config.brand`, `config.market`; NO `insuranceLine` in the derivation (symbol not referenced anywhere in S1). <!-- orianna: ok -->
  2. S2 404 during lazy-create: title derives with `brand="New Session"` fallback; lazy-create proceeds.
  3. S2 5xx: same fallback; WARN log.
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for chat lazy-create S2-fetch title (BD.C.3)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

### BD.C.4 — impl: chat lazy-create title via S2 (BUILDER)
- **What:** execute ADR §3.2 row 1395–1397 refactor. Replace three-key `session.get("config", {}).get(...)` reads with an S2 fetch; drop the `insuranceLine` key from the agent-title derivation entirely (per ADR: `insuranceLine` is not in S2 schema). Error handling same shape as BD.C.2.
- **Acceptance:** BD.C.3 tests pass.
- **Depends on:** BD.C.3.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): chat lazy-create title via S2 (BD.C.4)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

### BD.C.5 — xfail: `session_status` response shape shrinks + `session_history` via S2 (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_session_status_and_history_shapes.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `GET /session/{id}/status` response has keys subset of `{status, phase, createdAt, updatedAt, managedSessionId, factoryRunId, projectId, outputUrls, qcResult}`. No `logos`, no `configVersion`, no `brand`/`market` (per OQ-BD-2 + OQ-BD-3 resolutions).
  2. `GET /session/{id}/history` (if the endpoint exists — see ADR §3.2 row 1987–2001): summary row's `brand` field comes from a `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(...)` call, not from `session.config.brand`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  3. History on S2 404: summary shows `brand: null` with a UI-safe fallback; no error.
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for status/history shape changes (BD.C.5)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

### BD.C.6 — impl: `session_status` shrink + `session_history` S2 fetch (BUILDER)
- **What:** execute ADR §3.2 rows 1461–1472 and 1987–2001.
  - `session_status`: drop `logos` field (§3.2 row 1461–1472, per OQ-BD-2). Drop `configVersion` from response (not on session doc post-BD.B.4). Drop `brand`/`market` if present. Response is strictly lifecycle.
  - `session_history`: rewrite the `cfg = session.get("config") or {}` path to `cfg = await config_mgmt_client.fetch_config(session_id)` (or skip on 404). For version history (optional future feature), note that `GET /v1/config/{sessionId}/versions` is the S2 call; leave a `# TODO(SE.F)` marker — not in BD scope.
- **Acceptance:** BD.C.5 tests pass.
- **Depends on:** BD.C.5.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): session_status shrink + session_history via S2 (BD.C.6)`.
- **AI-min:** 30.

---

## Phase BD.D — Delete config-client leftovers

### BD.D.1 — xfail: `patch_config` + `sample-config.json` gone (TEST) <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **What:** `tests/test_config_client_and_sample_deleted.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. Importing `patch_config` from `tools.demo_studio_v3.config_mgmt_client` raises `ImportError`.
  2. `tools/demo-studio-v3/sample-config.json` does not exist (`os.path.exists` false). <!-- orianna: ok -->
  3. `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config` and `fetch_schema` still import and function (sanity guard — we're not deleting the keepers).
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict on 1–2; 3 passes.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for patch_config + sample-config.json deletion (BD.D.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 10.

### BD.D.2 — impl: delete `patch_config` + `sample-config.json` (BUILDER) <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **What:** execute ADR §3.7 row 94–108 + §3.8.
  - Remove `patch_config` function from `config_mgmt_client.py`. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - `git rm tools/demo-studio-v3/sample-config.json`. <!-- orianna: ok — cross-repo file in missmp/company-os; not a local path -->
  - Remove any imports/references of `patch_config` (runtime had none per ADR; test references fold into BD.A.2's "must delete" list).
- **Acceptance:** BD.D.1 tests pass.
- **Depends on:** BD.D.1.
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): delete patch_config + sample-config.json (BD.D.2)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

---

## Phase BD.E — Grep-gate extension

Extends SE.E.2's grep gate with the two patterns from ADR §2 Rule 4, and seeds the allowlist for known valid callers.

### BD.E.1 — xfail: grep gate catches new patterns (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_config_boundary_grep_gate.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. Create a synthetic file `tests/fixtures/bd_gate_violator.py` containing `session["config"] = {"foo": 1}` and run `scripts/grep-gate.sh` (or whatever entry point SE.E.1 produced). Gate exits non-zero. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  2. Synthetic file containing literal `"insuranceLine"` anywhere in source runs → gate exits non-zero.
  3. A file carrying `# azir: config-boundary` on the violating line → gate exits zero (whitelist comment works, per ADR §2 Rule 4 last paragraph).
  4. `main.py` (dashboard handler imports `config_mgmt_client`) does NOT trigger the gate (already on BD §3.14 allowlist). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict until BD.E.2 lands.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for config-boundary grep-gate patterns (BD.E.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

### BD.E.2 — impl: add two patterns to SE.E.2 gate config (BUILDER, cross-ADR)
- **What:** amend the SE.E.2 gate config (file lives in SE's scope; exact path TBD by Camille in SE.E.1/E.2). Add two regexes per ADR §2 Rule 4:
  - `session\[?["\']config["\']\]?\s*=` (assignment of `session["config"]` or `session.config`). <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Literal string `insuranceLine`.
  - Scope: files under `tools/demo-studio-v3/` excluding `tests/` and any explicit migration script. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Whitelist comment: `# azir: config-boundary` (mirrors SE.E convention of `# azir: <name>` suppressor).
- **Coordination:** if SE.E.2 has landed before BD.E.2 dispatch → amend it in this PR. If SE.E.2 is mid-flight → co-author with Camille (add patterns to her open PR). If SE.E.2 hasn't started → park BD.E.2 until SE.E.1 (gate infra) lands; BD.E.2 then follows as a thin amendment.
- **Acceptance:** BD.E.1 tests 1–3 green. Test 4 separately verified by BD.E.3.
- **Depends on:** BD.E.1; SE.E.1 (gate infra must exist). **Cross-ADR: coordinate with Camille (SE.E owner).**
- **Commit:** `feat(demo-studio-v3): extend grep-gate with config-boundary patterns (BD.E.2)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

### BD.E.3 — impl: seed grep-gate allowlist for dashboard handler + migration script (BUILDER)
- **What:** add to the SE.E.2 gate allowlist:
  - The dashboard list handler in `main.py` (MAD.B.2's `GET /api/managed-sessions` handler) — on BD §3.14 allowlist as an allowed `config_mgmt_client` caller. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Any explicit migration script path (if BD.B.* introduces one — ADR §8.1 recommends option B orphan, so likely no migration script; if B.4/B.6 needs one, it's listed here).
  - The pre-existing SE.A.6/SE.B.4 call sites that read config through `config_mgmt_client` (render/status/history — BD.C.2/C.4/C.6) — on BD §3.14 allowlist as allowed callers (they're the refactor targets, they SHOULD call the client).
- **Acceptance:** BD.E.1 test 4 green. Coordinated with MAD.E.1 (Kayn's MAD task that verifies this same allowlist entry).
- **Depends on:** BD.E.2. **Cross-ADR: MAD.E.1 re-verifies this allowlist post-merge.**
- **Commit:** `feat(demo-studio-v3): seed grep-gate allowlist for config_mgmt_client callers (BD.E.3)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

### BD.E.4 — ERRAND: grep-gate CI integration confirmation (ERRAND)
- **What:** confirm the extended gate runs on every PR to `feat/demo-studio-v3` via CI (piggy-backs on SE.E.2's CI hook). Run the gate against branch HEAD post-BD.B-H; it must be green. If the gate flags an unexpected site, decide: (a) legitimately violating → fix; (b) legitimate caller missing from allowlist → amend BD.E.3; (c) gate false-positive → refine regex (rare). <!-- orianna: ok -->
- **Acceptance:** gate green on the branch after all BD.B / BD.C / BD.D / BD.F / BD.G impl tasks have merged.
- **Depends on:** BD.E.3 + all BD.B/C/D/F/G impl tasks.
- **AI-min:** 25.

## Phase BD.F — Thin `POST /build {sessionId}` pass-through

Finishes the shell that BD.B.6 left behind for `trigger_factory*`.

### BD.F.1 — xfail: trigger_factory* thin pass-through shape (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_trigger_factory_thin.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `trigger_factory(session_id)` flow: (a) `session_store.get_session(session_id)` called once; (b) `session_store.transition_status(..., to="building")` called once; (c) `factory_client.start_build(session_id)` called with ONLY `{"sessionId": "..."}` — no `configVersion`, no `content`, no translated payload; (d) `session_store.update_session(session_id, factoryRunId=...)` called with the S3-returned run id; (e) returns 202/accepted.
  2. `trigger_factory_v2(session_id)` same shape against `factory_client_v2.start_build`.
  3. S3 5xx: `transition_status(to="building")` is rolled back (to="configuring" or whatever the prior status was) before raising — or the rollback posture is explicitly "no rollback, leave `building` for ops to notice". Choose the former if SE.A.6 exposes a rollback path; note the choice in impl PR description.
  4. No `config_mgmt_client.fetch_config` call on the factory path (regression guard against the old pattern creeping back).
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict. This task partially covers BD.B.5 items 5–6 that were left xfail.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for trigger_factory thin pass-through (BD.F.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 25.

### BD.F.2 — impl: thin `POST /build {sessionId}` in trigger_factory* (BUILDER)
- **What:** complete the `trigger_factory*` bodies per ADR §5.3 target pseudocode:
  ```
  POST /session/{id}/build (S1)
    └── session_store.get_session(session_id)    # lifecycle-only; no config read
    └── session_store.transition_status(..., to="building")
    └── factory_client.start_build(session_id)   # POST /build {sessionId} to S3
    └── session_store.update_session(factoryRunId=...)
    └── return accepted
  ```
  - `factory_client.start_build(session_id)` is an existing method or needs a small `body={"sessionId": session_id}` tweak — verify against current `factory_client.py`; if it currently sends a translated payload, shrink to `{sessionId}` per OQ-BD-6. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - Same for `factory_client_v2`.
  - **S3-side pre-flight:** per ADR §8.2, Sona must confirm S3's self-fetch path (S3 reads config from S2 itself) is live on stg/prod before BD.F.2 merges. If not live, hold BD.F.2 behind the same feature flag as MAD (`MANAGED_AGENT_DASHBOARD` is unrelated — this one is fresh: `S1_FACTORY_THIN_PASSTHROUGH=1`), default off in prod.
- **Acceptance:** BD.F.1 tests pass; BD.B.5 items 5–6 flip green.
- **Depends on:** BD.F.1, BD.B.6. **Cross-team: Sona confirms S3 self-fetch live before merge.**
- **Commit:** `feat(demo-studio-v3): trigger_factory thin POST /build {sessionId} (BD.F.2)`.
- **AI-min:** 30.

## Phase BD.G — Agent-init refactor (identity-only payload)

Covers the 2 refactor-rows in §3.14 that are `send_message` calls to the managed agent.

### BD.G.1 — xfail: agent-init message shape is identity-only (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_agent_init_identity_only.py`. Tests: <!-- orianna: ok -->
  1. `POST /session/new` flow: `send_message` (or whatever the agent-boot primitive is — §3.2 row 1219) is called with a payload containing ONLY `{brand, market, languages, shortcode}` (or whatever subset the body supplied). No `logos`, no `colors`, no `card`, no `params`, no `journey`, no `tokenUi`, no `insuranceLine`, no `persona`, no `ipadDemo`.
  2. Internal `POST /session` flow: same shape (§3.2 row 1284).
  3. If the body omits any of the four identity fields, `send_message` is called with only the supplied subset (no default-fill from a sample config).
  4. The message body is explicitly NOT `json.dumps(initial_context)` against a full config dict.
- **Acceptance:** xfail strict. The exact wire shape of the agent-init message is Kayn's to refine in SE.F.1 (per ADR §5.1) — BD.G.1 asserts only the minimal "strip full config, send identity four" invariant.
- **Commit:** `chore: add xfail tests for agent-init identity-only payload (BD.G.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

### BD.G.2 — impl: agent-init send identity fields only (BUILDER)
- **What:** execute ADR §3.2 rows 1219 and 1284 refactor. In both `create_new_session_ui` and internal `create_new_session`:
  - Replace `send_message(..., f"Initial context: {json.dumps(initial_context)}")` with a minimal payload carrying only `{brand, market, languages, shortcode}` from the request body.
  - Drop the `initial_context` local variable entirely (already dead after BD.B.2).
  - Leave a `# TODO(SE.F.1)` marker noting the wire shape is Kayn's to finalise.
- **Acceptance:** BD.G.1 tests pass.
- **Depends on:** BD.G.1, BD.B.2. **Cross-ADR: SE.F.1 refines the wire shape as a follow-up — BD.G.2 ships the deletion, not the final shape.**
- **Commit:** `refactor(demo-studio-v3): agent-init identity-only payload (BD.G.2)`.
- **AI-min:** 30.

---

## Phase BD.H — Deletion sentinel

Final cross-phase correctness guard. Asserts that every row on §3.14's 17-entry Delete list has actually been deleted at branch HEAD post-all-BD-phases. Catches silent regressions where a symbol was removed from one file but re-added in another.

### BD.H.1 — TEST: deletion-manifest sentinel (TEST)
- **What:** `tests/test_bd_deletion_sentinel.py`. For each entry in `tests/fixtures/bd_deletion_manifest.json` (from BD.A.1): <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - If entry is a symbol: `import`-based assertion that the symbol raises `ImportError` / `AttributeError`.
  - If entry is a file: `os.path.exists` false. <!-- orianna: ok -->
  - If entry is a Firestore key: inspect the create-session write payload (fixture-captured) and assert key absent.
  Aggregate all 17 assertions; any one fail fails the whole test. Print a per-row status report on failure so PR reviewers see which deletions regressed.
- **Acceptance:** test green at branch HEAD after BD.B, BD.C, BD.D, BD.F, BD.G all merged.
- **Depends on:** BD.A.1 (manifest), all BD.B/C/D/F/G impl tasks.
- **Commit:** `test(demo-studio-v3): BD deletion sentinel (BD.H.1)`.
- **AI-min:** 20.

## xfail TEST ↔ impl BUILDER pairing

Per Rule 12 every impl task is preceded on the same branch by an xfail test commit.

| xfail TEST | impl BUILDER | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BD.B.1 | BD.B.2 | B (main.py session-create) |
| BD.B.3 | BD.B.4 | B (session.py writes + list) |
| BD.B.5 | BD.B.6 | B (factory-translation delete) |
| BD.B.7 | BD.B.8 | B (preview route delete) |
| BD.C.1 | BD.C.2 | C (session_page title) |
| BD.C.3 | BD.C.4 | C (chat lazy-create) |
| BD.C.5 | BD.C.6 | C (status shrink + history) |
| BD.D.1 | BD.D.2 | D (patch_config + sample-config) |
| BD.E.1 | BD.E.2 | E (gate patterns) |
| BD.F.1 | BD.F.2 | F (thin factory pass-through) |
| BD.G.1 | BD.G.2 | G (agent-init identity-only) |

**11 TDD pairs.** Standalone tasks without paired impl: BD.E.3 (allowlist seed — small enough to fold into BD.E.2 but kept separate for PR-review granularity), BD.E.4 (gate-CI errand), BD.H.1 (post-merge sentinel — tests existing shape). Errands (no test commit needed): BD.0.1, BD.0.2, BD.A.1, BD.A.2.

---

## Risks & mitigations

1. **SE not yet decomposed.** Kayn is decomposing SE in parallel as of 2026-04-21. BD.B.2 and BD.B.4 target SE.A.4's signature; BD.E.2 targets SE.E.2's gate config. If SE decomposition produces a different SE.A.4 signature or a different SE.E.2 gate-file path than BD assumes, BD tasks need a minor amendment (one-line edits per task body). **Mitigation:** BD.B.2/B.4 authors coordinate with Kayn before dispatch; if mismatch, amend BD task body in-place (not a new task).
2. **S3 self-fetch not yet live.** ADR §8.2 requires confirmation from Sona before BD.F.2 merges. **Mitigation:** BD.F.2 proposes a `S1_FACTORY_THIN_PASSTHROUGH=1` flag as a kill-switch. Prod default off; stg default on. Flip to prod-on after S3 self-fetch confirmed.
3. **Migration posture — orphan live sessions.** ADR §8.1 recommends option B (orphan). If pre-deploy `SELECT count(*) FROM demo-studio-sessions WHERE status IN ('configuring','building')` returns >~5, manual outreach is needed. **Mitigation:** BD.0.1 should run the count as part of rebaseline. Not a task, but an operational checklist item — flag to Sona.
4. **Read-path latency (cold S2 cache).** Post-BD, every `/session/{id}` page render issues one GET to S2. ADR §9 accepts this; §5.2 suggests a short-TTL in-process cache. **Not in scope** for BD tasks — if p99 regresses post-deploy, file a follow-up. Do NOT pre-optimise.
5. **BD.B.4 ↔ SE.A.4 merge collision.** Both tasks touch `session.py::create_session`. If SE.A.4 lands before BD.B.4, BD.B.4 becomes an amendment on top. If BD.B.4 lands first, SE.A.4 absorbs BD's shape. Either order works as long as the two authors coordinate the branch. **Mitigation:** whichever breakdown is dispatched first becomes the anchor; the other rebases (merge — never rebase per Rule 11, so it's a merge-in).
6. **Gate false-positive in test fixtures.** The literal `"insuranceLine"` is the grep-gate trigger. Test files under `tools/demo-studio-v3/tests/` are already gate-excluded per ADR §2 Rule 4 (scope says "other than tests"), so existing test fixtures that mention `insuranceLine` in old-behaviour assertions don't trigger. BD.A.2's coverage map identifies those; they can stay until deleted naturally. **Mitigation:** confirm the gate scope excludes `tests/` in BD.E.2 impl. <!-- orianna: ok -->

## Open questions (OQ-BD-tasks-*)

All seven ADR-level OQs are RESOLVED. The following are task-decomposition-level residuals:

### OQ-BD-tasks-1 — BD.B.2 `insuranceLine` body rejection vs. silent drop
ADR §3.2 row 1192 says "Delete from S1 — the `insuranceLine` field is not in S2's `DemoConfig` schema at all". ADR doesn't specify whether the S1 `POST /session/new` Pydantic body should 422 on `insuranceLine` or silently drop it. BD.B.1 tests assert 422 (stricter — surfaces client errors). **Default: 422.** Flag to Sona if any known client still sends the field.

### OQ-BD-tasks-2 — Rollback on S3 5xx (BD.F.2)
ADR §5.3 pseudocode shows `transition_status(to="building")` before the S3 call. Does the task roll back to prior status on S3 5xx, or leave `building` for ops to notice? **Default: roll back to prior status** (assumes SE.A.6's `transition_status` is symmetric — confirm when SE.A.6 lands). BD.F.1 test item 3 asserts rollback. If SE.A.6 exposes no rollback path, BD.F.1 test rewrites to assert "no rollback, status stays `building`, ERROR log emitted, ops-page convention" and BD.F.2 matches.

### OQ-BD-tasks-3 — BD.E.2 gate-config file path
SE.E.2 hasn't decomposed yet; the exact gate-config file path (`scripts/grep-gate.sh` + `configs/grep-gate.yaml`? `scripts/config-boundary-gate.py`? some other shape?) is Camille's call. BD.E.2 body is written generically ("amend the SE.E.2 gate config"); exact file path is a fill-in on dispatch. **Not blocking** — resolved by a 5-minute coordination with Camille. <!-- orianna: ok -->

### OQ-BD-tasks-4 — BD.H.1 deletion-sentinel for Firestore-key entries
§3.14 includes "Firestore payload key" entries (`config`, `configVersion`). Asserting "Firestore write doesn't contain this key" requires either a fixture-captured payload or a Firestore-emulator integration test. BD.H.1 sketches "fixture-captured", but if SE.A.3/A.4 tests already capture the payload, reuse those fixtures. **Default: reuse SE.A.3/A.4 fixture if available; else capture a fresh one in BD.B.3.**

---

## Semantic gaps found in the ADR during breakdown

1. **BD.F.2 rollback posture on S3 5xx** — see OQ-BD-tasks-2. ADR §5.3 shows the happy path only; error-path rollback is unstated. Task defaults to "roll back to prior status" pending SE.A.6 confirmation.
2. **§3.2 row 1349 cold-session fallback text** — ADR says "fall back to 'New Session' on S2 404". What about S2 5xx? Same fallback? Task (BD.C.2) defaults to same fallback + WARN log. If a different semantic is wanted (e.g. 503 on the render itself), ADR needs an amendment.
3. **§3.14 refactor row "`main.session_history` brand/config read"** — the ADR talks about version history via S2's `listConfigVersions` but the S1 history endpoint doesn't currently expose version history. BD.C.6 task leaves version history as a `# TODO(SE.F)` marker and refactors only the brand-read path. **Flag: if Sona wants version history exposed in this ADR's scope, amend BD.C to add a sixth task (xfail + impl for version-listing).**
4. **ADR §3.2 row 1461–1472 `session_status` explicitly drops `factoryRunId?`** — No. ADR §5.5 says status keeps `factoryRunId?`. Reconciled: BD.C.5 test and BD.C.6 impl keep `factoryRunId` on the response. §3.2 row wording is loose ("lifecycle fields only") — interpret-aligned with §5.5 which is more explicit.
5. **§3.2 rows 1190/1250–1254 identity-field plumbing in request body** — ADR removes identity-field **persistence** on session doc, but the request body still accepts them (for agent-init). BD.B.2 task body is explicit about this. ADR could have been slightly clearer on "body accepts ≠ doc persists"; not a blocker.
6. **Migration script path for grep-gate exclusion (BD.E.3)** — ADR §2 Rule 4 exempts "tests and an explicit migration script", but ADR §8.1 recommends orphan option B (no migration script). If Duong later picks option A (backfill) or C (lazy backfill), a migration script appears and BD.E.3's allowlist needs a new entry. **Flag: if migration posture changes mid-flight, amend BD.E.3.**
7. **Pre-existing `test_no_local_validation.py:41-47`** — ADR §3.8 notes this is a pre-existing Jayce-unfinished xfail that BD.B.6 / BD.D.2 flip green. The test file name implies it asserts `sample-config.json` is gone — confirm by reading, and if it also asserts validate_v2.py is gone (likely), note both in BD.A.2 coverage map so it's clear the xfail becomes pass naturally. <!-- orianna: ok -->

---

## Test plan

Inherits ADR §Test plan I1–I4 and materialises:

- **I1 — Config-boundary gate:** BD.E.1 (gate tests) + BD.E.2/E.3 (gate config + allowlist) + BD.E.4 (CI confirmation).
- **I2 — Identity-field exclusion:** BD.B.3 (`create_session` write payload no identity fields) + BD.B.1 (`POST /session/new` flow doesn't persist identity fields).
- **I3 — Factory pass-through shape:** BD.B.5 (translation-gone regression) + BD.F.1 (thin `{sessionId}` POST shape).
- **I4 — Deleted symbols absent:** BD.B.5 / BD.B.7 / BD.D.1 per-phase tests + BD.H.1 (cross-phase sentinel against §3.14 manifest).

Rule 12 (xfail-first) applied to every BUILDER task per the pairing table above. Rule 13 (regression tests on bug fixes) does not apply — BD is pure refactor, not bug-fix.

---

## Handoff

- **Sona (work coordinator):** dispatch BD.0.1 + BD.0.2 first. Before BD.F.2 merges, confirm S3 self-fetch live on stg + prod (ADR §8.2). Run the §8.1 pre-deploy count query and decide outreach to in-flight session users (ADR recommends option B orphan). Watch Risk 5 (BD.B.4 ↔ SE.A.4 collision).
- **Kayn (SE breakdown):** coordinate SE.A.4 signature with BD.B.2/B.4; coordinate SE.F.1 agent-init wire shape with BD.G.2 (BD.G.2 ships "strip full config, send identity four"; SE.F.1 finalises the wire). Confirm SE.E.2 gate-config file path with Camille so BD.E.2 has the right target.
- **Camille (SE.E owner):** expect BD.E.2 amendment to your SE.E.2 gate-config PR — two new regexes + expanded allowlist. Co-author preferred.
- **Orianna:** BD.0.1 (line-number rebaseline) can surface drift against ADR §3's pinned `d327581`. If drift is material, ADR may need a minor patch — not a plan re-sign unless shape changes.
- **Jayce / Viktor / Viktor-flavour Sonnet builders:** tasks dispatched individually by Sona once SE/MAL breakdowns land.
- **Senna (reviewer):** the deletion manifest (BD.A.1 fixture) is your PR-review checklist; BD.H.1 is the automated sentinel.

**Summary:** 1 minor drift (§3.1 line 118–128 — actual range is 118–129). All other ADR-cited lines confirmed exact at `13fc893`. No function shapes changed. Builders may use symbol-based targeting (`list_recent_sessions`, `prepare_demo_dict`, etc.) and ignore the line-number discrepancy on the session.py row.

**Operational checklist item (Risk 3 from task file):** Pre-deploy count of in-flight sessions with `status IN ('configuring', 'building')` should be run before BD.B phases merge. Flag to Sona — not a BD task, but an ops gate.
